# History 
- Code base downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/XinhaoLi74/MolPMoFiT) on 8/29/2022. 
- The original .pth file including the model weights (ChemBL_atom_encoder.pth, available for download as listed above) was missing keys that a fastai method was looking for. A function was written to rename these keys, as well as include an empty "tensor" for key "1.decoder.bias‚Äù.
